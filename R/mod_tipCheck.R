#' @description A shiny Module. This module generates messages for the user
#' regarding the files uploaded and if column(s) for a heatmap is available.
#' This module contains 3 functions located in the golem_utils_server
#' file (sanity, not_columns, and m_file_conversion). Essentially. these
#' functions are used for checking or converting files for downstream analyses.

  #this will render the output from the sanity function found in the
  #golem_utils_server.R file and takes in 6 reactive files -
  #tree x2, genetic distance x2, meta data x2 - one file from each three sub
  #sections just acts as a confirmation that the file has been uploaded to
  #display the user messages. The other 3 files are the ones that either
  #sanity or not_columns functions test. For whatever reason, if I used
  #t_file_out instead of tree_file_out in L 61, the user message does not
  #display. In theory is.null(t_file_out) should render the message but it does
  #not. This could be one place for improvement. Reducing the number of
  #parameters required in thh tipCheck server from 6 to 3, especially since
  #for the example data, the files are repeated in the app_server.R file.
