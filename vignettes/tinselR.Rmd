### Why tinselR

Across the United States, public health laboratories at the state-level now
perform whole-genome sequencing for foodborne pathogens, a milestone for
protecting our food sources by identifying bacterial contamination at a higher
resolution than previous methods. To understand organismal relationships in
response to potential outbreak investigations from whole-genome data, building
and interpreting phylogenetic trees is essential for this public health
workflow. When data is combined from phylogenetic trees and epidemiology, 
potential sources in outbreaks link across temporal and spatial scales.
*Our goal was to develop an open-source phylogenetic tree visualization and
annotation graphical user interface, which will be made available for state
public health laboratories.* To accomplish this goal, we developed  **tinselR**
(pronounced tinsel-er) using the R shiny framework. We choose to build this
application in because of R's base graphics and additional phylogenetic packages
that are the gold standard for phylogenetic tree graphics. Our tool's minimum
input requirements are a Newick formatted phylogenetic tree in which user inputs
change parameters of the visualized tree. With either or both the genetic 
distance matrix and the metadata file, the user can include annotations on the
image, quickly adjust tip labels, and add a heatmap to the phylogenetic tree.
These modified phylogenetic tree images are downloadable in various formats for
presentations or publications. These images help public health officials and
stakeholders discuss the differences or similarities between isolates in
response to outbreaks. Below we will detail and outline how to use the 
application, using two example datasets.

### Getting started

#### *Testing with example data*

**Example data**

When the application is launched, the user can test out the application by
using one of the pre-loaded datasets located in the 'Example Data' tab (Figure
\@ref(fig:exampleDataPane1)). We provide three datasets (i.e. Newick-formatted
tree, genetic distance matrix, and metadata file) already combined with the
number of isolates ranging from 14 - 19. These data are either *Eschericia coli*
(NCBI Bioproject: PRJNA218110) or *Salmonella enterica* (NCBI Bioproject: 
PRJNA230403). After clicking on the 'Example Data' tab
(Figure \@ref(fig:exampleDataPane1)), the user selects from one drop down menu
for one of the combined datasets (e.g. example data 1, example data 2, and
example data 3; (see Figure \@ref(fig:exampleDataPane2)). 


```{r exampleDataPane1, echo = F, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "Landing page for tinselR with 'Example Data' tab circled in blue"}
knitr::include_graphics("Slide1.SVG")
```

```{r exampleDataPane2, echo = F, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "'Example Data' tab highlighting within the blue box the available  tree visual parameters that can be changed."}
knitr::include_graphics("Slide2.SVG")
```

**Displaying example tree and genetic distance data**

Once you have selected one of the datasets, to begin using the application, 
press the 'Visualize Tree' button. At this point all potential tree visual
parameters you want to alter are available using drop down menus
(e.g. annotation label color), user input (e.g. size of scale bar), or 
users selection (e.g. midpoint root). All tree visual parameters that a user 
can adjust are displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:exampleDataPane3).

With the genetic distance file uploaded, a user can highlight clades to 
add annotations which will display the range and median of SNPs for tips that
are included in the highlighted selection (Figure \@ref(fig:exampleDataPane4)
and Figure \@ref(fig:exampleDataPane5)). To correctly display the annotation, 
the user should highlight the tips of interest and include within the 
highlighted section their most recent common ancestor, 
(Figure \@ref(fig:exampleDataPane4) and Figure \@ref(fig:exampleDataPane5)). In 
theory, one can add as many annotations as you want, though at some point the
annotations may run off the plot area and thus you may need to add more
space to plot (Tree visual parameter - 'Add Spacing to Plot'). The ability to
change spacing to the plot is one of the tree  visual parameters that can be
adjusted (Figure \@ref(fig:exampleDataPane3)). We would also recommend to only
include those that help describe the outbreak clades of interest. Any annotation
placed on the plot can be removed by pushing the 'Remove Annotations' button.
Unlike with the 'Add Annotation' button, you do not need to highlight which
annotation you would like to remove. Because of this, the remove annotations
works by removing the last placed annotation until there are no more. 

```{r exampleDataPane3, echo = F, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "Pre-loaded example dataset 1 is selected and can be seen once the user presses the 'Visaulize Tree' button, which is shown within the blue box."}
knitr::include_graphics("Slide3.SVG")
```

```{r exampleDataPane4, echo = F, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "Pressing 'Visualize Tree' button will allow the tree to be viewed on screen. Within the larger blue box, a phylogenetic tree is displayed with tips right aligned. The smaller blue box indicates that the 'align the tips' box has been selected."}
knitr::include_graphics("Slide4.SVG")
```

```{r exampleDataPane5, echo = F, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "With tips of interest highlighted, pressing the 'Add Annotations' button will add annotations to the tree image, which indicate the range and median of SNPs for these tips of interest. The tree with annotations is within the larger blue box, while the buttons for add and removing annotations are in the smaller box on the left of image. "}
knitr::include_graphics("Slide5.SVG")
```

**Including metadata for tip correction and heatmap**

Figure \@ref(fig:exampleDataPane6) provides an example metadata file with 
three columns: 1) 'Tip.labels'; those tip labels within in the Newick-formatted
tree, 2) 'Display.labels'; what you would like the tip labels in the tree to be
changed to, and 3) a third column called what you, the user, what that column
reflects. Here, the third column is called 'SourceSite' indicating the
collection site of the isolates. When the metadata is included and a user pushes
the 'Visualize Tree' button, automatic tip correction occurs, meaning that the
tips within the Newick-formatted tree convert to what you the user decided 
(e.g. 'Display.labels' column in metadata file). The ability to add a 
[heatmap](https://yulab-smu.top/treedata-book/chapter7.html),
allows the user to include either categorical or numerical data for their tree 
image either with or without annotations (Figure \@ref(fig:exampleDataPane7)). 


```{r exampleDataPane6, echo = F, out.width = "50%", fig.cap = "Example metadata 1 with the third column highlighted in blue indicating information used for adding a heatmap. "}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("inst/app/www/metaDataExample.PNG"))
```

```{r exampleDataPane7, echo = F, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "Tree image with annotations and a heatmap of collection source displayed within blue box at the bottom of the image. The add/remove heatmap is also within the blue box on the left of the image."}
knitr::include_graphics("Slide7.SVG")
```

**Downloading your image**

Once you are happy with the way your tree looks, you can download the image 
in either pdf, png, or tiff formats (Figure \@ref(fig:exampleDataPane8)). Make 
sure you adjust the height and width of the image that you download. Note that
once the image has downloaded, if you want to re-download with anything changed,
just adjust as you wish and push the 'Download' button again.

```{r exampleDataPane8, echo = F, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "Tree image with annotations and a heatmap of collection source displayed. The download image options is within the blue box on the bottom of the image."}
knitr::include_graphics("Slide8.SVG")
```

#### *Using your data*

There is only two differences between the 'Example Data' and the 'Data Upload'
tabs: the example data tab has pre-loaded data, while the data
upload tab is where you, the user, can upload your own files (i.e. tree, 
genetic distance, and metadata). By that we mean, in the 'Example Data' tab,
the user only has three options to select from - example data 1, example data 2,
and example data 3 - displayed in one drop down menu. While in the 'Data Upload'
tab, there are three drop down menus - 1) tree upload, 2) genetic upload, and 3)
meta upload (Figure \@ref(fig:userDataPane1)).

```{r userDataPane1, echo = F, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "'Data Upoad' tab for user's own data upload The larger blue box contains the three dropdown menus for the three different files a user can upload. The smaller blue boxes indicates the 'Data Upload' tab."}
knitr::include_graphics("Slide9.SVG")
```

Given problems that can occur during user upload, we provide file upload error
messages in hopes of helping, you the user, with checking that all three files
are concordant in terms of tip label information as this is the main mechanism
of connecting the three files. If there is variation in the three files, a 
message will be displayed to the user regarding how the file tip labels differ.
File checking happens independently of if the user wants the information.
By that, we mean a user can ignore the file check messages if they do not need
them and proceed using the application. Please note that this concordant tip 
checking will only display a message if all three files are uploaded (tree, 
genetic, and meta). However, some file checking does occur for the genetic and 
meta data independent of if all three files are uploaded. Beyond the mechanism
in which the user starts using the application ('Data Upload' or 'Example Data'
tab) the application is exactly the same, thus why we highly encourage
users to play with the example data first just to familiarize yourself with the
application. Note, we have only tested the application using trees with ~ 30
tips with success, beyond that we are interested to see how the application
does. Below we will describe the types of data you can upload. 

The application relies on treeio's function read.newick (`treeio::read.newick`), 
to read in a Newick-formatted tree. treeio is associated with the package
ggtree, which extends the ggplot2 plotting system to phylogenetic trees. In
theory, any application  that can produce a Newick formatted tree should be
able to be uploaded. 

Currently, our application only supports a genetic distance matrix of SNP 
differences (Figure \@ref(fig:userData2)). Your distance matrix can be in either
csv, tsv, or txt formats. The metadata file should be in one of these formats 
as well (csv, tsv, or txt). However, the metadata file requires specific column
headers (Tip.labels, and Display.labels; Figure \@ref(fig:userData3)),
but the third column, if you choose to include it can be titled whatever. 

```{r userData2, echo = F, out.width = "50%", fig.cap = "Genetic distance matrix example with tip labels that match the Newick phylogeneti tree."}
knitr::include_graphics("geneDistanceExample.PNG")
```

```{r userData3, echo = F, out.width = "50%", fig.cap = "Meta data example without the heatmap column."}
knitr::include_graphics("metaDataExample.PNG")
```

One caveat to note, is that if the user does this specific sequence of steps,
the tree image will be wiped and not include clade annotations already drawn 
on the tree. However, we expect this sequence of events to rarely happen. 

**Order of events - **

* upload phylogenetic tree
* upload genetic distance matrix
* annotate tree 
* upload metadata - after this file is uploaded all annotations drawn on the 
tree will be removed.
